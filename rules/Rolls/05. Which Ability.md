# Which Ability?

The ability depends mostly on the type of roll:
- **Skill Rolls.**
	- By far the most common type of actions
	- This can be accomplished using one of the 18 skills listed on the Character Sheet.
- **Combat Rolls.**
	- When involved in a fight, the player-heroes rely mostly on their Combat Proficiencies to make attack rolls, and on the PROTECTION rolls to avoid being seriously injured when hit
- **Shadow Tests.**
	- The corrupting effect of the Shadow can be resisted by making VALOR and WISDOM rolls, prompted by sources such as Dread, Sorcery, and Greed
