- Miserable
	- You become miserable when your shadow points exceed your *current* Hope score, they become Miserable
	- When miserable, a roll of an Eye of Sauron (11), the action fails, regardless of whether the success dice meet the TN
- Weary
	- When your Endurance drops to a level equal to or lower than your Load score, you become Weary
	- When a Weary hero is making a roll, all the Success Dice that come up showing a result in an outlined number (1, 2, or 3) are considered to have given a result of zero instead.
		- See pages 49 and 69 for more about Load and Endurance, respectively
- Wounded
	- Serious injuries can cause a hero to become Wounded.
	- While losing and recovering Endurance is an everyday occurrence, being Wounded is a more serious predicament for an adventurer and will affect them for much longer. Heroes are Wounded most often in combat.
	- Wounded heroes who remain active risk being knocked out of combat and recover lost Endurance points more slowly (see Resting, page 71).
