- **Cancel a failure**
	- If a Skill roll involves multiple players, you help another Player-hero who failed; the failed roll is considered a  success.
- **Score 1 additional success**
	- If an action requires multiple successes to be achieved, you score 1 additional success.
- **Gain insight**
	- You gain additional information, not necessarily related to the task at hand.
		- For example
			- While helping a  sick individual with a HEALING roll you discover the trace of poison. 
			- Or you spot a sentry while sneaking into a ruin with a roll of STEALTH.
- **Go quietly**
	- You achieve your goal noiselessly or without otherwise attracting attention.
- **Make haste**
	- You complete the attempted task in a shorter time (about half the expected time).
- **Widen influence**
	- You can influence more than the specific number of subjects originally targeted by the action.
	- As a general rule, each Success icon spent corresponds to one additional subject or group of subjects. 
		- For  example, 
			- following a roll of INSIGHT, you spot a second person acting suspiciously at an inn
			- a roll of  ENHEARTEN aimed to affect half a dozen individuals allows you to influence a full dozen
