Once the necessity to roll dice has been determined, follow the steps below to make a die roll.  

1. Define what the Player-hero is trying to achieve with the roll
	- determine its consequences, both in the case of success and failure.
2. Select the ability to be used for the roll. 
	- Players are encouraged to suggest the appropriate ability. 
	- The difficulty for the action is based on the relevant Attribute TN.  
3. Take one Feat Die and a number of Success Dice equal to the rating of the chosen ability 
	- (or two Feat Dice, if the roll is Favoured or Ill-favoured). 
	- Spend 1 Hope to gain (1d), or (2d) if Inspired.
4. Make the roll. 
	- If the roll is Favoured, choose the best result on the Feat Dice, or the worst if Ill-Favoured.
	- If you roll a (12), the action is automatically a success
	- If you roll an (11), and you are miserable, you fail automatically instead. Otherwise, it's worth 0.
5. Otherwise, all numerical dice results are added up to get the action result. If you are Weary, all Success Dice results in outline (1, 2 and 3) are ignored.  
	- If the total action result is equal or superior to the relevant Target Number, the action is a success. If the result is lower than the Target Number, the action has failed.
6. If the action is successful, the number of results rolled indicates the degree of success, and can be spent to achieve a special success.
