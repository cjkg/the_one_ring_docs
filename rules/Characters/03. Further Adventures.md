# Further Adventures

## Adventuring Career

- It is rare for any hero to adventure for more than 10 or 20 years, simply because of how harsh the struggle against Shadow is.
  - Excellence is achieved in about 10 years of game time
  - This means that a Player-hero should reach ranks of 5 and higher in VALOUR and WISDOM (and equivalent prowess in Combat Proficiency) in 10 years of game time.
- Heroes should name an heir
  - Players who die without an heir will have to create a new character from scratch
- Raising an Heir
  - To name their heir, players must choose the Raise an Heir undertaking during any Yule Fellowship Phase (see p. 120)
    - Then they must spend up to 5 Treasure points and an equal amount of Adventure points to form the heir's Previous Experience
    - For each Adventure point spent, raise the reserve by 1
    - Then they name the heir, who can be anyone, but it would make sense if it was someone close to the Player-hero
  - Once the heir has been named, they can repeat this process 
    - That is, they can spend up to five more Treasure points and Adventure points to increase the heir's Previous Experience in subsequent Yule Fellowship phases.
    - This process maxes out once the heir has reached a maximum of 20 previous experience points
  - An heir is ready to continue the Player-hero's legacy once they hit 10 previous experience points]
- Creating the Heir
  - When the Player-hero retires, the player must create a new heir
    - Players designate one of their hero's *Favoured* Skills as their "family heritage"
      - The heir receives this as a free, additional *Favoured* Skill.
    - The heir's starting Standard of Living is equal to that of the retiring Player-Hero, not their culture's
  - Instead of receiving 10 points to raise starting Skills/Combat Proficiencies, heirs get the number of points accumulated in their Previous Experience reserve
    - use the Skill and Combat Proficiency costs tables on page 46
    - Skills cannot be raised above the fourth rank
    - Combat Proficiencies cannot go beyond the third rank
  - Heirlooms
    - If the Previous Experience is 15+, then *one* item is passed from the Player-hero to the heir as an Heirloom
    - If the Previous Experience is 20, then *two* items are passed from the Player-hero to the heir as an Heirloom
    - Famous Weapons and Armour
      - These have their first quality automatically activated when taken up by an heir
        - further qualities can be 'awoken' in the manner described on page 78, as the new Hero gains level of VALOUR
      - In the case of Wondrous Artefacts, its blessings are revealed upon passing the item to the heir
