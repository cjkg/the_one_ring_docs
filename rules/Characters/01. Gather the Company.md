## Gather the Company
To create a Company, the players and the Loremaster must follow the sequence described below:

1. Choose Patron (list on p. 52)
2. Choose a Safe Haven
	- Starting base of operations for the group, and where they return between Adventure phases
		- The Prancing Pony Inn in Bree, for example
	- The Player-Heroes can create new Safe Havens as time goes on 
3. Determine the Company's Fellowship Rating
	- Pool of points shared among all Player-Heroes that is used to recover lost confidence
		- During the adventuring phase, Player-Heroes can use points of Fellowship to regain points of Hope while resting
		- Fellowship can also be spent to trigger special effects tied to the company's Patron (see table on p. 52)
	- Players must agree on when to use a fellowship points, and update it on each of their sheets
	- Fellowship points are fully refreshed at the end of each game session 
4. Choose Fellowship Focus
	- Players are free to indicate any other Player-hero as being a person they are especially bonded to as their Fellowship Focus
	- Mechanically, 
		- **Advantage:** Player-heroes provide *(2d)* instead of *(1d)* when they help their Fellowship focus
		- **Disadvantage:** Player-heroes gain 1 shadow point whenever their Fellowship Focus:
			- is Wounded
			- has a Bout of Madness
			- is otherwise seriously harmed
				- This cannot be prevented with a Shadow Test (i.e., by VALOUR or WISDOM rolls)
		- It doesn't have to be mutual: one person's fellowship focus doesn't need to reciprocate
		- It doesn't have to be exclusive: multiple Player-heroes can have the same focus fellowship target
