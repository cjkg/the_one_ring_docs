## Answer the Call to Adventure (p. 44)
1. Choose a calling, from among 
	- Captain
	- Champion
	- Messenger
	- Scholar
	- Treasure Hunter
	- Warden
2. Spend Previous Experience Points
3. Choose your starting Gear (p. 48)
	-  Starting heroes can choose 1 weapon for each combat proficiency for which they have a rating, and their *favoured* selection of armour, helms, or shield
	- Record your Gear on your character sheet
		- **NOTE:** PROTECTION score of a coat of armour is recorded separately from a helm
			- A hero can take off their helmet to reduce LOAD and avoid becoming WEARY too soon
		-  **NOTE:** A shield’s rating is recorded separately from the main box devoted to Parry, as a shield can be smashed by an opponent’s blows.
			- Shields do not offer direct protection, but make a hero less likely to be hit, by providing a bonus to Parry.
		- **NOTE:** Traveling items do not need to be recorded in detail, and do not count against LOAD (49). LOAD is monitored only as far as War Gear and Treasure is concerned.
		- **NOTE:** You can carry up to your LOAD score, which is equal to your ENDURANCE. You should keep updating this as your LOAD changes in game, as it has a lot of effects.
			- However, you want to carry much less than your LOAD score or you'll easily become WEARY. (See p. 69 for Endurance)
	- Determine your Useful Items you have based on your Standard of Living (pp. 49-50)
	- See p. 50 for pack Ponies and Horses
4. Record your VALOUR and WISDOM scores at 1
	- A rank in WISDOM grants you a Virtue
	- A rank in VALOUR grants you a Reward
5. Choose your Starting Reward and Virtue (Chapter 5, p. 79 and 80 respectively)
