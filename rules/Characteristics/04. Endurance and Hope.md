# Endurance and Hope

- Endurance and Hope are set during character creation
  - They are maximum scores
    - Player-heroes lose Endurance points as the result of exertion and suffering harm
    - Player-heroes lose Hope points voluntarily when they must succeed against difficult odds

## Endurance

- Endurance represents a Player-hero's resistance and is taken into account whenever an adventurer is subjected to some form of harm
  - Lose through effort or damage
  - Players whose Endurance is reduced to zero drop unconscious, and wake up after one hour with 1 Endurance point
    - unless they are also Wounded (see p. 101)
- WEARY
  - Heroes become WEARY if their Current Endurance score becomes equal to or less than their total Load
- FATIGUE
  - Traveling causes players to accumulate Fatigue points
    - This only comes into play exclusively in conjunction with the rules for journeys (see p. 108)
  - When gained, Fatigue points temporarily raise a Player-hero's total Load
- RESTING
  - SHORT REST:
    - Maximum of one short rest per day
    - About one hour of inactivity
    - Unless wounded, adventurers recover a number of lost Endurance points equal to their STRENGTH rating
      - Wounded Player-heroes don't recover any points at all
  - PROLONGED REST:
    - Maximum of one prolonged rest per day
    - Unless wounded, Player-heroes regain all lost Endurance points
      - Wounded Player-heroes recover *n* Endurance points, where *n* = STRENGTH score

## Hope

- Hope is a Player-hero's reserve of spiritual fortitude and positivity
  - Players with no Hope cannot push themselves beyond their limits
- MISERABLE
  - Heroes become MISERABLE when their Shadow score >= their Hope score
  - They remain MISERABLE until their Hope score > Shadow score
- Recovering Hope
  - Spend Fellowship
    - During the *Adventuring* Phase, whenever the Company is resting, the Player-heroes can all agree to spend any number of Fellowship points to restore an equal number of Hope points to all Player-heroes
  - Take a Break from Adventuring
    - During the *Fellowship* Phase, all Player-heroes regain *n* Hope points, where *n* = their HEART score
  - Resting
    - Players who are down to zero Hope, recover a single point of Hope once they take a Prolonged Rest
