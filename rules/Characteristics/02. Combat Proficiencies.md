# Combat Proficiencies

- Basics
  - Rolls made using Combat Proficiencies are resolved as Skill rolls:
    - Roll 1 Feat Die and *n* Success Dice, where *n* = Combat Proficiency rank
  - They are not divided into categories, as they are all rolled against the STRENGTH TN when making Attack rolls (See p. 93ff for more)
  - Combat Skills can never be *Favoured*
  - They can only be improved by spending Adventure points, *not* Skill points
